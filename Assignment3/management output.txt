MFT Simulation:
Enter total memory size: 5
Enter partition size: 4
Enter number of processes: 3
Memory divided into 1 partitions
Enter size of Process 1: 3
Process 1 allocated.
Enter size of Process 2: 4
Process 2 allocated.
Enter size of Process 3: 6
Process 3 too large for fixed partition.

MVT Simulation:
Enter total memory size: 6
Enter number of processes: 4
Enter size of Process 1: 1
Process 1 allocated.
Enter size of Process 2: 5
Process 2 allocated.
Enter size of Process 3: 4
Process 3 cannot be allocated. Not enough memory.
Enter size of Process 4: 2
Process 4 cannot be allocated. Not enough memory.
